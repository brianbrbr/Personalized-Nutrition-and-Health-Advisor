      "**Nutrition Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Your calorie intake varies significantly from day to day, ranging from 247 to 567 calories. Aim for a consistent daily calorie intake of 350-400 calories to support your active lifestyle.\n",
      "* Your protein intake is generally high, which is excellent for muscle growth and repair. However, it's essential to balance your protein intake with complex carbohydrates and healthy fats.\n",
      "* Your carbohydrate intake is moderate, but you may benefit from increasing your complex carbohydrate sources, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n",
      "* Your fat intake is relatively low, which is in line with your preference for low-fat foods. However, ensure you're getting enough healthy fats from sources like nuts, seeds, and avocados.\n",
      "* Your fiber intake is excellent, with an average of 7-8 grams per day. Continue to prioritize fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Health Status:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Your weight has been fluctuating, but it's essential to focus on a sustainable weight management plan rather than rapid weight loss or gain.\n",
      "* Your cholesterol levels are slightly elevated, with an average of 184 mg/dL. Consider increasing your soluble fiber intake and incorporating more omega-3 rich foods to help lower your cholesterol levels.\n",
      "* Your blood pressure is generally within a healthy range, but there are some fluctuations. Continue to monitor your blood pressure and maintain a balanced diet to support heart health.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Personalized Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consistency is key:** Aim for a consistent daily calorie intake of 350-400 calories to support your active lifestyle. Divide your daily calories into 3-4 main meals and 2-3 snacks to maintain energy levels.\n",
      "2. **Balance your macronutrients:** Ensure you're getting the right balance of protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats at each meal. Aim for:\n",
      "\t* 30-40% of daily calories from protein\n",
      "\t* 40-50% of daily calories from complex carbohydrates\n",
      "\t* 20-30% of daily calories from healthy fats\n",
      "3. **Incorporate more complex carbohydrates:** Increase your complex carbohydrate sources, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, to support energy production and fiber intake.\n",
      "4. **Healthy fats are essential:** Include sources of healthy fats like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil in your diet to support heart health and satisfy hunger.\n",
      "5. **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day to support overall health and athletic performance.\n",
      "6. **Monitor and adjust:** Continue to track your health data and adjust your diet and exercise routine as needed to achieve your goals.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Meal Plan Suggestions:**\n",

      "\n",
      "**Lifestyle Changes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gradually increase physical activity:** Start with short, intense workout sessions (20-30 minutes) and gradually increase duration and frequency.\n",
      "2. **Incorporate strength training:** Focus on exercises that target your core, legs, and glutes, such as squats, lunges, and deadlifts.\n",
      "3. **Flexibility and stretching:** Incorporate stretching exercises to improve flexibility and prevent injuries.\n",
      "4. **Breakdancing classes:** Enroll in breakdancing classes to learn proper techniques and get feedback from experienced instructors.\n",
      "5. **Evening walks:** Continue your evening walks to improve cardiovascular health and increase overall physical activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specific Breakdancing Tips:**\n",

      "\n",
      "**Personalized recommendations to achieve your BBOY goal:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Balance your macronutrients:** Aim for a daily intake of 25-30% protein, 40-45% carbohydrates, and 25-30% fat. This will help you maintain energy levels and support muscle growth.\n",
      "2. **Increase healthy fats:** Focus on adding sources of healthy fats like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil to your meals. This will help you feel more satisfied and provide sustained energy.\n",
      "3. **Choose complex carbohydrates:** Instead of relying on white rice, try incorporating more complex carbohydrates like brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, and vegetables into your meals.\n",
      "4. **Hydrate adequately:** Make sure you're drinking at least 8-10 glasses of water per day to help with digestion and overall health.\n",
      "5. **Monitor your weight:** Try to maintain a consistent weight by eating balanced meals and avoiding excessive carbohydrate intake.\n",
      "6. **Incorporate strength training:** As a BBOY, you need to focus on building strength and power. Incorporate strength training exercises into your workout routine, targeting your core, legs, and upper body.\n",
      "7. **Get enough rest:** Adequate rest and recovery are crucial for muscle growth and repair. Ensure you're getting 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a sample meal plan to help you get started:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Breakfast:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* 2 whole eggs\n",
      "* 1 cup cooked oatmeal with banana and almond butter\n",

      "**Snack:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* 1 medium apple\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon almond butter\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dinner:**\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "* Your diet seems to be balanced, with a good mix of carbohydrates, protein, and fiber. However, there are some inconsistencies in your calorie intake, which may affect your energy levels and weight.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consistent Calorie Intake:** To maintain a stable weight and energy levels, aim for a consistent daily calorie intake of 2500-2800 calories. This will provide you with the necessary energy for your afternoon gym sessions and support your overall health.\n",
      "2. **Macronutrient Balance:** Focus on a balanced diet with the following macronutrient ratios:\n",
      "\t* Carbohydrates: 55-60% of daily calories (complex carbs like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables)\n",
      "\t* Protein: 20-25% of daily calories (lean protein sources like chicken, fish, and legumes)\n",
      "\t* Fat: 15-20% of daily calories (healthy fats like nuts, seeds, and avocados)\n",
      "3. **Hydration:** Ensure you're drinking at least 8-10 glasses of water per day to stay hydrated and support your physical performance.\n",
      "4. **Electrolytes:** As a marathon runner, it's essential to replenish electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium) lost during exercise. Incorporate electrolyte-rich foods like bananas, dates, and coconut water into your diet.\n",
      "5. **Cholesterol Management:** To reduce your cholesterol levels, focus on consuming:\n",
      "\t* Soluble fiber-rich foods like oats, barley, and fruits\n",
      "\t* Plant-based protein sources like legumes, nuts, and seeds\n",
      "\t* Healthy fats like avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish\n",
      "6. **Incorporate Marathon-Specific Nutrition:** As you progress in your marathon training, incorporate specific nutrition strategies to optimize your performance:\n",
      "\t* Carb-loading: 2-3 days before a long run or marathon, increase your carbohydrate intake to 70-80% of daily calories\n",
      "\t* Hydration and electrolyte replenishment: During long runs, consume electrolyte-rich drinks and snacks to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance\n",
      "7. **Gradually Increase Your Running Distance and Intensity:** To avoid injuries and allow your body to adapt, gradually increase your running distance and intensity over time. Aim to increase your weekly mileage by no more than 10% each week.\n",
      "8. **Strength Training:** Incorporate strength training exercises 2-3 times a week to improve your running efficiency and reduce the risk of injuries. Focus on exercises that target your core, glutes, and legs.\n",
      "9. **Rest and Recovery:** Adequate rest and recovery are crucial for your body to adapt to the demands of marathon training. Ensure you're getting 7-9 hours of sleep each night and taking rest days as needed.\n",
      "10. **Monitor Your Progress:** Regularly track your diet, training, and health metrics to monitor your progress and make adjustments as needed.\n",
      "\n",
